By studying Venus, astronomers and geologists can predict what might happen to Earth in the future. Gaining an understanding of Earth's future may well allow scientists to predict what happened in Earth's past. Scientists are eager to learn about the early years of Earth's past, as it is shrouded in mystery, and this thirst for knowledge motivates them to study Venus. In describing how similar Venus was to Earth, the author says, \\\"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life\\\" (4). If there was once life on Venus, the similarity between it and Earth would grow. As with geology, if biologists can understand what caused life to cease on Venus, they might be able to predict how life on Venus and on Earth might have started. The author shows that scientists studying Venus reap the reward of being able to learn about Earth's geology and early life. By laying out the various rewards to be had from studying Venus, the author is strengthening his or her argument that Venus should be studied. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

By studying Venus, astronomers and geologists can predict what might happen to Earth in the future. Gaining an understanding of Earth's future may well allow scientists to predict what happened in Earth's past. Scientists are eager to learn about the early years of Earth's past, as it is shrouded in mystery, and this thirst for knowledge motivates them to study Venus. In describing how similar Venus was to Earth, the author says, \\\"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life\\\" (4). If there was once life on Venus, the similarity between it and Earth would grow. As with geology, if biologists can understand what caused life to cease on Venus, they might be able to predict how life on Venus and on Earth might have started. The author shows that scientists studying Venus reap the reward of being able to learn about Earth's geology and early life. By laying out the various rewards to be had from studying Venus, the author is strengthening his or her argument that Venus should be studied. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

By studying Venus, astronomers and geologists can predict what might happen to Earth in the future. Gaining an understanding of Earth's future may well allow scientists to predict what happened in Earth's past. Scientists are eager to learn about the early years of Earth's past, as it is shrouded in mystery, and this thirst for knowledge motivates them to study Venus. In describing how similar Venus was to Earth, the author says, \\\"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life\\\" (4). If there was once life on Venus, the similarity between it and Earth would grow. As with geology, if biologists can understand what caused life to cease on Venus, they might be able to predict how life on Venus and on Earth might have started. The author shows that scientists studying Venus reap the reward of being able to learn about Earth's geology and early life. By laying out the various rewards to be had from studying Venus, the author is strengthening his or her argument that Venus should be studied. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"predicted_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Evidence\",\n          \"Rebuttal\",\n          \"Counterclaim\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"matched_topic_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3212,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"I think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. \",\n          \"Is it not time for a change in the Electoral College? \",\n          \"asking advice from multiple people can help you \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["final_opinions_df.to_csv(\"opinions.csv\", index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"AfQj6A0XA5Cm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750668046881,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":592,"user":{"displayName":"Ayşe Çetin","userId":"12197011360243059859"}}},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["conclusion_df.to_csv(\"conclusions.csv\", index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"YnUIblA7A9hT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750668049265,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":59,"user":{"displayName":"Ayşe Çetin","userId":"12197011360243059859"}}},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"-YbMgfNh8nac"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
